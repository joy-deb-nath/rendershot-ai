Of course. Here is a detailed ASCII wireframe and component breakdown for a developer and designer, based on your provided UI.

The breakdown is structured into two states for the main canvas area.

-----

### UI Wireframe Breakdown: RenderCam AI Studio

This interface is a three-column layout designed for an AI image generation workflow.

1.  **Sidebar (Navigation)**: Fixed on the left.
2.  **Main Content (Studio)**: The central interactive area.
3.  **Control Panel (Settings)**: Contextual controls on the right.

-----

### **State 1: Initial / Empty Canvas**

This is the default view when a user first enters the studio. The canvas is empty, prompting the user for an initial image.

#### **Component Description (State 1):**

  * **`Sidebar`**:
      * **Purpose**: Main application navigation.
      * **Elements**:
          * **Logo**: "RenderCam AI".
          * **Nav Links**: Static links like "Dashboard" and a group for "Features".
          * **User/Auth**: A "Logout" control at the bottom.
  * **`ImageUploader` (Inside Canvas)**:
      * **Purpose**: The primary call-to-action to begin the workflow.
      * **Elements**:
          * An "Upload" button/dropzone.
          * A `DemoImagePicker` component offering pre-selected product images to quickly test the feature.
  * **`ControlPanel`**:
      * **Purpose**: Houses all the settings and parameters for image generation. It remains empty or disabled until an image is loaded onto the canvas.

-----

### **State 2: Image Loaded / Active Session**

This view is active after a source image is uploaded or selected. The UI becomes interactive, displaying the selected image and a filmstrip of related images.

+----------------------+--------------------------------------------------+-------------------+
```

#### **Component Description (State 2):**

  * **`CanvasView`**:
      * **Purpose**: Displays the currently active image (either the source or a generated one).
      * **Elements**:
          * The main image display area.
          * **`CanvasControls`**: Overlayed icons, typically at the top-right.
              * **Download Icon `[↓]`**: Downloads the image currently shown in the `CanvasView`.
              * **Clear Icon `[X]`**: Clears the canvas and filmstrip, resetting the interface to State 1.
  * **`Filmstrip`**:
      * **Purpose**: A gallery to manage and switch between the source image and all generated variants.
      * **Behavior**:
          * The first item is always the original "Source Image".
          * Newly generated images are appended to this strip.
          * Clicking on any image thumbnail in the filmstrip will load it into the main `CanvasView`.
          * The currently active/selected thumbnail should have a distinct visual style (e.g., a colored border, overlay, or `<*...*>` highlight).
  * **`ControlPanel` (Active)**:
      * **Purpose**: Now active, it displays all relevant controls to manipulate the source image and generate new ones (e.g., style selection, background options, model choice, etc.). Actions taken here will result in new images being added to the `Filmstrip`.
